# Package Delivery Application
## Project Objectives
1. Model the delivery scenario using Python object-oriented principles.
1. Import CSV files into the program as useable package and distance data.
1. Implement a hash table data structure that stores the package data to allow efficient data retrieval and future scalability.
1. Use a self-adjusting heuristic algorithm to plan the delivery routes and reduce the mileage of the delivery trucks.
## Technologies Used
1. Written in Python
1. PyCharm IDE
## Description
The objective of this program is to deliver 40 packages throughout a city within specified time and distance constraints. The program utilized a hash table data structure for storing the package data. Using the hash table allowed the main algorithm to access package data in O[1] time complexity. The program provides a console user interface which allows the user to view which delivery truck delivered each package at the end of the day. The interface also allows searching for a specific package's status at a specific time during the day.
